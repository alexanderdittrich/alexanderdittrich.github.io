## Research Interests
I am interested in a wide variety of topics ranging from robotics, control, dynamical systems and machine learning and particularly where these areas overlap.

## Biography
I am a doctoral assistant at the [Laboratory of Intelligent Systems](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lis/) at EPFL, under the guidance of Dario Floreano. I hold a Bachelor's and Master's degree in Mechatronics from [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/) and was a visiting student at [Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University](https://english.spbstu.ru/). 

During my academic journey, I have actively engaged in various intriguing projects. At [Greenteam Uni Stuttgart](https://www.greenteam-stuttgart.de/), I designed mechanical components of a high-performance electric race car. In a research thesis, I was working on activity recognition algorithms of biomechanical motion data for improving the control of upper-body exoskeletons at [Fraunhofer IPA](https://www.ipa.fraunhofer.de/). I developed as intern a demonstrator for distributed control concepts in the dynamic systems control group at [Robert Bosch GmbH](https://www.bosch.de/). At [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/), I worked with [Dieter Büchler](https://ei.is.mpg.de/person/dbuechler) on the improvement of the capabilities of a muscle-based table tennis robot.
