Master's Intern at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/).

## Research Interests
My research interests are on the intersection of control, machine learning and robotics. I want to contribute to the next generation of robotic systems leaving predictable lab environments and solving tasks in the real-world.

## Biography
Currently, I am working with Dieter BÃ¼chler as Graduate Intern at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) in the Intelligent Soft Robots group in the Empirical Inference department, on the improvement of the capabilities of a muscle-based table tennis robot. I received a Bachelor's and about to receive a Master's degree in Mechatronics at [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/). In 2017, I was a visiting student at [Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University](https://english.spbstu.ru/).
