PhD student at [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/lis/).

## Research Interests
I am interested in a wide variety of topics ranging from control, dynamical systems and machine learning and particularly where these areas overlap.

## Biography
I am a Master's student in Mechatronics at [University of Stuttgart](https://www.uni-stuttgart.de/). In 2019, I received a Bachelor's degree in (also) Mechatronics (also) at University of Stuttgart. In 2017, I was a visiting student at [Peter the Great St. Petersburg Polytechnic University](https://english.spbstu.ru/). Throughout my studies, I had the opportunity to gather hands-on experience on numerous projects. At [Greenteam Uni Stuttgart](https://www.greenteam-stuttgart.de/), I designed mechanical components of a high-performance electric race car. In a research thesis, I was working on activity recognition algorithms of biomechanical motion data for improving the control of upper-body exoskeletons at [Fraunhofer IPA](https://www.ipa.fraunhofer.de/). In 2021, I developed as intern a demonstrator for distributed control concepts in the dynamic systems control group at [Robert Bosch GmbH](https://www.bosch.de/). Currently, I am working with [Dieter Büchler](https://ei.is.mpg.de/person/dbuechler) at [Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems](https://is.mpg.de/) on the improvement of the capabilities of a muscle-based table tennis robot.
